## Description
- We made an initialization of the shell, where at start the user can see the Welcome message and his/her username printed on the terminal screen.
- Immediately upon entering the shell, a prompt is displayed with a precisely defined layout according to the instructions. Two colors are applied to the appearance of the prompt, purple and cyan, which are made via functions, ```purple()``` and ```cyan()```, as well as the ```colorReset()``` function, which resets the color of the letters each time and returns to the technical settings.
```
void purple()
{
	printf("\033[0;35m");
}

void cyan()
{
	printf("\033[0;36m");
}

void colorReset()
{
	printf("\033[0m");
}
```
